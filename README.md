# react_todos
 Todo List app made with React


With all the skills you have learned so far, you will create a Todo List Application

* When the page loads, your app should render a list of items from an array of data. 

* If the item is not completed, render the item on the page.
* Your app should have an input that allows the user to enter a new item to the to do list.
* When the user submits the form (presses enter) the value in the input should be added as an item on your to do list.
* The app should also use conditional styles to cross out the item when it is completed and to highlight the background of the item when it isnâ€™t completed.
